# Philosophy

## The Feeling

Plaza evokes **a hacker's command terminal from a cyberpunk future**. You're accessing a decentralized network through a CRT monitor in a dimly lit room, neon lights bleeding through the window blinds.

The design sits at the intersection of **1980s terminal interfaces** and **sci-fi holographic displays**.

Blade Runner meets MS-DOS.

## Mood & Atmosphere

### Dark and Immersive
Pure black backgrounds create depth. Colors float in space. The interface feels infinite.

### Glowing and Electric
Neon accents suggest digital energy. Things feel powered on, alive, humming with data.

### Utilitarian Yet Beautiful
Function-first design elevated by careful color choices. No decoration for decoration's sake.

### Secretive and Underground
Using Plaza feels like exclusive access to hidden channels. You're not a user — you're an operator.

## Color Language

### Primary: Warm Orange
A spectrum from **burnt amber (#ff8800)** to **deep rust browns**. This is the dominant color — borders, text, buttons, everything interactive.

Orange feels warm against cold black. Like firelight in darkness.

### Accent: Electric Cyan
**Bright cyan (#00ffff)** for highlights, personal elements, secondary states. Creates visual contrast against orange.

Cyan says: "this is yours" or "this is special."

### Backgrounds: Deep Black
**Pure black (#000000)** dominates. Subtle orange-tinted browns for hover states. The darkness makes colored elements feel like they're floating.

### Semantic Colors
- **Red/Magenta** — errors, danger, destructive
- **Yellow** — warnings, caution
- **Green** — success, confirmation

## Shapes & Geometry

### No Rounded Corners. Ever.
Every element has hard 90-degree angles. Buttons, inputs, modals, containers — all sharp.

Rounded corners feel too friendly, too modern, too *app-like*. This is non-negotiable.

### Strong Borders
**2px borders** for interactive elements (demands attention).
**1px borders** for decorative/informational elements (ambient presence).

This distinction tells users what's clickable without thinking.

## The Summary

**Plaza looks like:** A secure terminal for the decentralized future — dark, glowing, sharp-edged. Orange neon warmth against infinite black. Cyan highlights for personal elements. Monospace everywhere. No curves.

**Plaza feels like:** Accessing something exclusive and powerful. You're not just using an app — you're operating a system. The aesthetic rewards attention and creates a sense of being "in the know."

# Scene and animation composer

Public editor: **https://cypherpunk.agency/editor/**. The same editor is packaged locally.
Public edits remain in the browser; download a bundle before closing. Importing a bundle is one
undoable operation. Public editing does not change the published game or write repository files.

## Local workflow

From repository root:

```sh
pnpm --filter plaza-design-demo compose-scenes
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:4192`. The separate loopback source service uses port 4193. Use `--port`
and `--api-port` to choose others. Ctrl+C stops both. Restart after renderer or schema changes.

1. Select a scene. Layout, logic and private Play refer to the same pending source documents.
2. Change the appropriate typed controls. Edit artwork placement/layers in the composition;
   interactions, actors, objectives, dialogue and access in scene/gameplay source; devices,
   cables and registered controller inputs in their own source.
3. Use Undo/Redo and private Play to inspect pending changes. Play consumes the real game engine,
   including pending companion documents. Stop destroys its isolated realm; Reset uses its selected
   starting fixture. Private progress does not read or write campaign saves.
4. Download edits for transfer or recovery. Import edits into either editor as a validated bundle.
5. In the local composer, use Save to source to commit validated companion changes together.
   Conflicts and invalid references reject atomically. The local recovery journal supports source
   Undo; it is separate from player saves and disposable test output.
6. Rebuild the homepage to use saved edits. Publishing remains a separate action.

The editor uses one shared frame: navigator, stage and inspector. Scene and animation screens,
viewers and world tools retain that common structure.

## Available authoring

All 19 existing scenes have composition, ordinary content, device/controller sources and native
Play. Ordinary actors, interactions, readables, rest points and exits can be created, removed and
rebound. Existing physical calculations and drawing algorithms remain code primitives with typed
inputs; the editor changes their declared parameters rather than editing arbitrary TypeScript.

Ordinary scenes can be created through the catalogue and connected through world source, without
adding a per-scene TypeScript registry entry. World/story definitions cover places, routes, access,
transport and narrative handoffs. Saved state declarations own their defaults, types and lifetimes.

Native devices are restricted by actual source/controller dependencies, not by whether a device
existed in the original game. Remove or rebind dependent references together. Explicit bindings to
missing artwork, conversations, commands or endpoints must reject. Deleting optional source fields
must not restore hard-coded defaults from an older definition.

Animated compositions use the same registered artwork as the game: attachments, layers, appearance,
clips, camera tracks, text, fades and handoffs. Scrubbing is inspection; it must not grant rewards or
commit a scene transition. A runtime sequence commits its handoff once on completion or valid skip.
Environmental animation uses prepared time, weather and lighting, preserving deterministic seeds.

Asset, character, vehicle and signage viewers show the registered library and supported states.
Their catalogues live under `authoring/catalogues/`; they are current configuration, not milestone
acceptance records. Event/source inspection describes hooks and references without executing them.
Captured runtime observations must match the declared scene/expression before being shown as live.

## Isolation and source safety

Private Play uses an opaque-origin frame and memory storage. The static public bundle contains no
source-write service or credentials. The local service accepts allowlisted documents, validates the
prospective whole graph and protects revisions. A source panel or preview alone does not establish
that edits work: verify actual private Play and the relevant Save/fresh reload/bundle/Undo paths.

## Testing and feedback

Use `?demo` for compact Purchases, Conversations and Devices & wiring examples. Review shortcuts
jump directly to the example. The Demo world lab uses real pending definitions with disposable
progress. The isolated manifest example demonstrates ordinary declared content without adding a
campaign location.

Run `pnpm test:game --list` from packages/plaza-design-demo. Select relevant names, for example
`pnpm test:game conversation source-removal`. The default runs all current checks. Test output is
`.game-test-output/` at repository root; old migration captures are unnecessary. Browser visual
contracts cover all 19 scenes plus selected environment/hack states; see
[the test guide](../../../../scripts/game-tests/README.md).

The agent checks mechanics, permissions, persistence and disposal. User feedback should address
clarity, appeal, pacing and authoring comfort. See [review routes](../docs/reference/REVIEW-GUIDE.md).

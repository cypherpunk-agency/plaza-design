# User Flows

This document describes the wallet connection and user flows for the Plaza application.

> **See also:** [Architecture Documentation](./architecture.md) for technical details on hooks, state management, and common pitfalls.

## Overview

The app supports **guest browsing** - users can view all public content without connecting a wallet. Wallet connection is only required for write actions (posting messages, creating channels, sending DMs, etc.).

When connected, the app supports two wallet modes:
- **Browser Wallet**: Uses MetaMask or other injected wallet providers
- **Session Account**: Creates a wallet stored in localStorage (no browser extension required)

---

## Flow 0: Guest Browsing (No Wallet)

For users who want to explore the app before connecting.

```
1. User opens app (first visit)
2. App loads immediately - no wallet modal appears
3. User can:
   - View all channels in sidebar
   - Read messages in any channel
   - View user profiles
   - Browse the app freely
4. When user tries to:
   - Post a message (clicks input or types)
   - Create a channel (clicks "+ New Channel")
   - Start a DM (clicks "+ New DM")
5. WalletChoiceModal appears
6. User chooses wallet type and continues
```

**Key implementation:**
- `walletConfig.canRead` is always true (uses RPC provider)
- `walletConfig.canWrite` requires connected wallet
- `requireWallet()` callback triggers modal on write actions
- Read hooks enabled without wallet (just need registry address)

---

## Flow 1: New User with Session Account

For users who don't have MetaMask or prefer not to use it. Users start from guest browsing and connect when needed.

```
1. User browses as guest, then tries to post/create
2. WalletChoiceModal appears
3. User clicks "Session Account"
4. SessionAccountSetup modal appears showing:
   - Generated wallet address (copyable)
   - Current balance (starts at 0)
   - Faucet instructions with link to https://faucet.polkadot.io/?parachain=1111
5. User copies address and requests PAS tokens from faucet
6. User clicks "Refresh" to update balance
7. Once balance > 0, "Continue" button becomes enabled
8. User clicks "Continue"
9. Profile is auto-created with address-derived name (e.g., "0x1a2b3c4d")
10. Session key is auto-created for encrypted DMs
11. User enters main chat UI in standalone mode, ready to chat and receive DMs
```

**Key files:**
- `WalletChoiceModal.tsx` - Initial wallet selection
- `SessionAccountSetup.tsx` - Faucet instructions and balance check
- `useAppWallet.ts` - Standalone wallet management
- `utils/appWallet.ts` - localStorage wallet storage

---

## Flow 2: New User with Browser Wallet

For users with MetaMask or similar browser extension. Users start from guest browsing and connect when needed.

```
1. User browses as guest, then tries to post/create
2. WalletChoiceModal appears
3. User clicks "Browser Wallet"
4. MetaMask popup appears for connection approval
5. User approves connection
6. User enters main chat UI in browser mode
7. User types a message and sends
8. Profile is auto-created if none exists
9. Message is posted to the channel
```

**Optional gasless messaging setup:**
```
10. User opens Settings
11. User sees "Set up session account for gasless messaging" section
12. User clicks "Setup Session Account"
13. App creates delegate wallet and registers it on-chain
14. User funds the delegate wallet
15. Future messages are sent via delegate (no MetaMask popups)
```

---

## Flow 3: Returning User with Existing Session Account

For users who previously created a session account.

```
1. User opens app
2. App detects existing standalone wallet in localStorage
3. User automatically enters standalone mode
4. Balance is fetched from Paseo Asset Hub RPC
5. User can immediately start chatting
```

**Detection logic:**
- `hasStandaloneWallet()` checks localStorage for saved wallet
- If found, `walletMode` is set to `'standalone'` on app load

---

## Flow 4: Session Account User Links Browser Wallet

For users who started with session account but want to use their browser wallet.

```
1. User is in standalone mode with session account + profile
2. User opens Account Modal
3. User clicks "Connect Browser Wallet"
4. MetaMask popup appears
5. User approves connection
6. LinkBrowserWalletModal appears with two options:

   Option A - Add as Delegate:
   - Browser wallet is added as delegate for session account profile
   - User stays in standalone mode
   - Browser wallet can post on behalf of session account profile

   Option B - Transfer Ownership (Recommended):
   - Profile ownership transfers to browser wallet
   - All profile data (name, bio, links) moves to browser wallet
   - Session account profile is deleted
   - User switches to browser mode
   - Profile is refreshed to show under browser wallet
```

**Key files:**
- `LinkBrowserWalletModal.tsx` - Options for linking
- `useUserRegistry.ts` - `transferProfileOwnership()` and `addDelegate()`

---

## Flow 5: Disconnect and Reconnect

```
1. User is connected (either mode)
2. User opens Account Modal
3. User clicks "Disconnect"
4. App state resets:
   - browserWallet.disconnect() called
   - appWallet.disconnect() called
   - walletMode set to 'none'
5. AccountModal closes
6. WalletChoiceModal appears
7. User can choose browser or in-app wallet again
```

**Note:**
- Disconnecting preserves the session account in localStorage but persists the disconnected state
- Page refresh keeps user disconnected (wallet mode stored in localStorage)
- When user selects "Session Account" again, they get the same wallet back with their funds intact
- To permanently delete a standalone wallet, use `appWallet.deleteStandaloneWallet()` (not yet exposed in UI)

---

## Flow 6: Auto Profile Creation

When a user posts a message without an existing profile.

**Note:** Users must be connected first (see Flow 0). Standalone (in-app wallet) users get their profile auto-created immediately after wallet setup (see Flow 1). This flow primarily applies to browser wallet users who send a message before creating a profile via AccountModal.

```
1. User is connected and clicks send on a message
2. handleSendMessage checks if wallet is connected (requireWallet)
3. handleSendMessage checks if profile exists
4. If no profile:
   a. Toast shows "Creating profile..."
   b. createDefaultProfile() is called on UserRegistry contract
   c. Profile is created with display name = "0x" + first 8 hex chars of address
   d. Session key is auto-created for encrypted DMs
   e. Toast shows "Profile created!"
4. Message is posted
```

**Contract function:**
```solidity
function createDefaultProfile() external {
    require(!profiles[msg.sender].exists, "Profile already exists");
    string memory defaultName = _addressToShortString(msg.sender);
    profiles[msg.sender] = Profile({
        owner: msg.sender,
        displayName: defaultName,
        bio: "",
        exists: true
    });
    emit ProfileCreated(msg.sender);
}
```

---

## Flow 7: Export Private Key

For session account users who want to backup their wallet.

```
1. User is in standalone mode
2. User opens Account Modal
3. User clicks "Export Private Key"
4. PrivateKeyExportModal appears with:
   - Strong warning about keeping key secret
   - Private key hidden by default
   - "Show Private Key" button
   - Confirmation checkbox required
5. User checks confirmation box
6. User clicks "Show Private Key"
7. Private key is revealed
8. User can copy to clipboard
```

**Security notes:**
- Private key is stored in localStorage (not encrypted)
- Users should export and backup if they have significant funds
- Clearing browser data will delete the wallet
- Disconnecting does NOT delete the wallet - it remains in localStorage
- Use `deleteStandaloneWallet()` to permanently remove the wallet

---

## Flow 8: Creating an Unlisted Channel

For users who want a private channel not listed in the sidebar.

```
1. User is logged in with a profile
2. User clicks "+" next to Channels in sidebar
3. CreateChannelModal appears
4. User enters channel name and optional description
5. User selects "UNLISTED" channel type
6. Warning appears: "Unlisted channels are not saved anywhere. Save the URL!"
7. User clicks "CREATE"
8. Transaction is submitted - ChatChannel is deployed directly (not via registry)
9. Success screen shows the channel address
10. User can:
    - Copy the channel address
    - Copy the full URL with ?channel= parameter
11. User clicks "DONE"
12. User is automatically navigated to the new unlisted channel
```

**Important:**
- Unlisted channels are NOT stored in the ChannelRegistry
- Users must save the URL or channel address to access the channel again
- Anyone with the URL can post (uses Open posting mode)
- The channel creator is automatically the owner

**Key files:**
- `CreateChannelModal.tsx` - Channel creation with type selection
- `useChannelRegistry.ts` - `deployUnlistedChannel()` function

---

## Flow 9: Managing Channel Permissions

For channel owners and admins to manage posting permissions.

```
1. User is owner or admin of a channel
2. "MANAGE" button appears in ChannelHeader
3. User clicks "MANAGE"
4. ChannelModerationModal opens with tabs:

   POSTERS tab (for Permissioned channels):
   - Shows current posting mode
   - Add poster by wallet address
   - Remove poster by wallet address
   - Switch between Open and Permissioned modes (owner only)

   ADMINS tab:
   - Promote user to admin (owner only)
   - Demote admin (owner only)

   SETTINGS tab (owner only):
   - View current owner address
   - Transfer ownership to new address
```

**Posting Modes:**
- **Open:** Anyone with a profile can post
- **Permissioned:** Only owner, admins, and allowed posters can post

**Key files:**
- `ChannelModerationModal.tsx` - Moderation UI
- `useChannel.ts` - Moderation functions (`addAllowedPoster`, `removeAllowedPoster`, `promoteAdmin`, `demoteAdmin`, `transferOwnership`, `setPostingMode`)
- `ChannelHeader.tsx` - Shows "MANAGE" button for authorized users

---

## Flow 10: Changing Posting Mode

For channel owners to switch between Open and Permissioned modes.

```
Open → Permissioned:
1. Owner opens Moderation Modal
2. Goes to POSTERS tab
3. Clicks "SWITCH TO PERMISSIONED"
4. Transaction submitted
5. Now only allowed posters can send messages

Permissioned → Open:
1. Owner opens Moderation Modal
2. Goes to POSTERS tab
3. Clicks "SWITCH TO OPEN MODE"
4. Transaction submitted
5. Now all users with profiles can send messages
```

---

## Flow 11: Viewing User Profile (Inline)

When clicking a user's name in chat or user list.

```
1. User clicks on a username in chat feed or user list
2. openProfile() is called with the user's address
3. Previous state is saved:
   - Current viewMode (channels/dms)
   - Current channel or DM address
4. URL updates to ?profile=0x... via pushState
5. Profile overlay appears over main content area
   - Covers chat + user list
   - Sidebar remains visible
6. User can view profile, follow/unfollow, start DM
7. To close:
   - Click "x" button or "CLOSE" button
   - OR press browser back button
8. Previous URL is restored
9. Original view (chat/DM) is revealed
```

**URL behavior:**
- Opening profile: `?channel=0x...` → `?profile=0x...`
- Closing profile: `?profile=0x...` → `?channel=0x...` (restored)
- Browser back: Works naturally via pushState

**Key files:**
- `App.tsx` - `openProfile()` callback, `previousViewState` tracking
- `UserProfileModal.tsx` - Inline profile overlay component

## DM Requirements

Direct Messages use end-to-end encryption (ECDH + AES-256-GCM). For DMs to work, **both parties** must meet requirements:

| Requirement | Current User | Target User |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| Has profile | Must have created on-chain profile | Must have created on-chain profile |
| Has session key | Must have session key in localStorage AND on-chain | Must have session key published on-chain |

**"Send DM" Button States:**
- **Enabled**: Both users meet all requirements
- **Disabled (gray)**: One or more requirements not met
  - Tooltip: "Both users need a profile to send DMs"

**Key files:**
- `UserProfileModal.tsx` - Button in popup profile overlay
- `ProfileView.tsx` - Button in full profile view
- `useUserRegistry.ts` - `hasSessionPublicKey()` function
- `UserRegistry.sol` - On-chain session key storage

---

## Channel Types

| Type | Posting | Registry | Access |
|------|---------|----------|--------|
| **Open** | Anyone with profile | Listed in sidebar | Public |
| **Permissioned** | Allowlist only | Listed in sidebar | Public (view), Restricted (post) |
| **Unlisted** | Anyone with profile | NOT listed | Direct URL only |

---

## Wallet Mode States

| Mode | Active Address | Active Provider | Signer |
|------|---------------|-----------------|--------|
| `'none'` | null | null | null |
| `'browser'` | browserWallet.address | browserWallet.provider | provider.getSigner() |
| `'standalone'` | appWallet.appWalletAddress | standaloneProvider (JsonRpcProvider) | appWallet.appWallet |

---

## Network Configuration

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Symptom | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Balance shows 0 during setup | `provider` prop is null before mode changes | Use `appWallet.provider` (connected during init) |
| Balance shows 0 after connect | Wrong provider passed to hook | Ensure `walletConfig.activeProvider` is used |
| "Contract not available" | `getSigner()` called on JsonRpcProvider | Use `createWriteContract()` with external signer |
| "no such account" | Signer not connected to provider | Check `walletConfig.canWrite` before write operations |
| Profile disappears after transfer | Profile not refreshed | Add useEffect to refresh on mode change |
| Modal behind modal | Parent modal not closed | Close parent modal before opening child |
| Infinite re-renders | Hook object in useEffect deps | Only depend on primitive values, not whole hook return |
| Can't post messages | Wallet not connected | Click message input to trigger wallet connection |

### Debug Checklist

1. **Check wallet mode**: Is `walletMode` correct for the current state?
2. **Check canRead/canWrite**: Is `walletConfig.canRead` true for reading? Is `walletConfig.canWrite` true for write operations?
3. **Check provider**: Is `walletConfig.activeProvider` available? (Should always be - uses RPC)
4. **Check signer**: Is `walletConfig.signer` available for write operations?
5. **Check dependencies**: Are useEffect dependencies causing infinite loops?
6. **Guest mode**: Remember users can browse without wallet - check `requireWallet()` for writes

### Console Debugging

Add this to App.tsx temporarily to debug state:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('Wallet State:', {
    mode: walletMode,
    canRead: walletConfig.canRead,
    canWrite: walletConfig.canWrite,
    activeAddress: walletConfig.activeAddress,
    hasSigner: !!walletConfig.signer,
    providerType: walletConfig.activeProvider?.constructor.name,
  });
}, [walletMode, walletConfig]);
```
